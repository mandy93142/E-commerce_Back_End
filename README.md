Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

Link to the video: 

## Overview

The goal is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.


## Features

The Express.js API with Sequelize and MySQL offers straightforward and effective database management. Here's a breakdown of its features:

- **Easy Database Connection:** Simply by entering your database name, MySQL username, and password in an environment file, you can connect to your MySQL database using Sequelize.

- **Database Setup and Seeding:** Running schema and seed commands creates a development database and fills it with test data, making it easy to get started.

- **Starting the Server:** With just one command, the server starts, and Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database, ensuring everything is up-to-date.

- **Testing GET Routes:** Using Insomnia Core, you can open API GET routes for categories, products, or tags. This shows you the data in a clear JSON format, making it easy to see and understand.

- **Testing POST, PUT, DELETE Routes:** Insomnia Core is also used for testing POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove) routes. This means you can easily modify data in your database.
